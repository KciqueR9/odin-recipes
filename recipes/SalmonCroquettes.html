    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>These crispy salmon croquettes are made with fresh salmon, but they cook quickly. The filling has onion, red bell pepper, and fresh parsley which adds so much flavor. Delicious as an appetizer with tartar sauce for dipping.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless salmon fillets</li>
        <li>½ cup baking mix (such as Bisquick)</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced red bell pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Finely chop the salmon using a food processor</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer salmon to a bowl. Add baking mix, onion, bell pepper, parsley, egg, garlic, Worcestershire, seasoned salt, and seafood seasoning; mix well until well combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Form the mixture into 8 small patties, and place onto a plate lined with waxed paper. Refrigerate the patties for 15 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place cornmeal into a shallow dish and dredge each patty in cornmeal, pressing lightly so that the cornmeal adheres to both sides of the patties.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook patties in the oil until golden and cooked through, working in batches, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.</p></li>
    </ol>
